# CS 203: Introduction to Computer Science Programming Assignments
By Jason Yao

## Description
A repository of any Java programmes made for "Intro to Computer Science (CS203)" 
while at the University of Portland.

Any code not my own is marked so, and their respective authors retain full rights. 

This repository's purpose is to showcase programming assignments completed for this course.

Date: Spring, 2014

Location: University of Portland

Professor: Dr. Karen Ward

Language(s): Java

## Course outcomes
- Created a strong foundation for computer science and the software development process

- Emphasis on good design and programming techniques through practice in writting, running, and debugging programs

- Designed and constructed Java programmes that included the following features:
	- Input/output
	- Variables
	- Strings
	- Conditionals
	- Loops
	- Methods

- Designed and constructed Java programmes that:
	- Used graphics 
	- Could create, store, and retrieve data from arrays
	- Wrote to, and read from files
	- Utilised recursive methods
	- Implemented classes (including instance variables, constructors, methods, and inheritance relationships)

- Learned programme testing and error fixing techniques

- Learned Javadoc and formed good habits with documentation

## Thanks
Notes: These are my first true coding attempts for the assignments given. Innumerable thanks are in order for
Dr.Ward for being such a kind and dedicated professor during my stay with the University of Portland-
Any coding achievements in the future can be sourced to this one wonderful lady.
