CS203
=====

A repository of any Java Programs made for "Intro to Computer Science (CS203)" while at the University
of Portland. Any original code will be marked so- this repository is for my personal educational use only,
along with keeping an updated, version-controlled, cloud-based storage for all code written while at the University
of Portland.

This repository may also be used to show educational instructors or businesses my personal coding history.

Date: Spring, 2014
Location: University of Portland
Professor: Dr. Karen Ward
Language(s): Java

Notes: These are my first true coding attempts for the assignments given. Innumerable thanks are in order for
Dr.Ward for being such a kind and dedicated professor during my stay with the University of Portland-
Any coding achievements in the future can be sourced to this one wonderful lady.
